        <h1>Our Recipes</h1>
        <p>The keto diet is excellent for losing fat and keeping it off. For example, a meta-analysis of 13
            randomized controlled
            trials concluded that:
            “Individuals assigned to a VLCKD [very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet] achieve a greater weight loss
            than those
            assigned to an LFD [low-fat diet] in the long term; hence, a VLCKD may be an alternative tool against
            obesity.”
            What’s more, randomized controlled trials found that the keto diet produces up to three times as much
            weight loss as a
            high-carb, low-fat diet.</p>

                <p>Nothing brings the family together like our Sage Sausage Stuffing. This combination of fresh
                    vegetables, herbs and our
                    Jimmy Dean® Sage Pork Sausage Roll will make this side dish a holiday staple!</p>

                <h3><b>Pumpkin soup</b></h3>
                <p>Some recipes should be kept simple as nature intended them to be, and in my opinion, Pumpkin Soup is
                    one of those
                    dishes. The natural flavour of pumpkin is good enough that you need very little to make a beautiful,
                    creamy, full
                    flavoured soup.</p>

                <h3><b>Mediterranean Chickpea Salad</b></h3>
                <p>Thanks to the chickpeas, this salad will keep you full for hours. It's satisfying in a way that leafy
                    greens never could
                    be. Sorry not sorry, kale.</p>
